For the latest version, get it from the git repository:
	git clone http://src.endnode.se/git/csm/

This program uses rrdtool toghether with its own python code to collect and store running data about your system.
It is mostly aimed at OpenVZ VPS systems having a /proc/user_beancounters file but it will work fine on other systems as well.

Requirements:
	python
	rrdtool, both command line and python bindings
	
	in Ubuntu: apt-get install python rrdtool python-rrd

Installation/Upgrade:
	Copy config-dist.py into config.py and change the contents within.

	For OpenVZ user_beancounters statistics:
		/proc/user_beancounters is not readable by ordinary users, to read it:
		- move bean.sh to /root/bin/bean.sh
		- run visudo and add the following line:
			statuser            ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: /root/bin/bean.sh
		  Where statuser is the username you will be running csm-update.py as.

Collect data:
	Your system must be running update.py to collect data about you project.
	The data is stored in rrd files in rrd/ which are created automatically.

Generate graphs:
	python graph.py [hours]
	Generates png images into the images folder for the last [hours], default 24.
